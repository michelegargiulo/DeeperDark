## Deeper Dark
A Minecraft 1.12.2 mod to customize the Extra Utilities Deep Dark dimension.

### How it works
The mod uses the power of Mixins to replace the Deep Dark IChunkProvider (the class responsible for the placement of blocks and worldgen features) with my own version

### Features
The mod features the ability to customize the following properties:
- Floor and Ceiling height
- Bedrock Thickness and roughness
- Surface and ceiling thickness and roughness
- Block replacement for Bedrock floor, ground, surface, spires, ceiling surface, ceiling and bedrock ceiling, water/lava in water/lava lakes
- Spire girth (height is adjusted automatically depending on ground and ceiling height)
- Stalactite maximum height
- Generation of Water and Lava lakes
- Generation of structures and dungeons
- Generation of caves and ravines

### What's missing?
- Ability to configure Biomes -> Use JustEnoughDimension to override the BiomeProvider
- Ability to un-ban Dirt, Gravel, Diorite, Andesite and Granite generation -> Use mods like CoFH world to generate them
